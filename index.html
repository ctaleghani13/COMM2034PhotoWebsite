							<h2>P and T Corner</h2>
							<p>This is a picture I took on the corner of Turner Street and Perry Street. This photo is unedited and focuses on the bush that is leafless compared to the other two. I felt like this was a cool image that really depicted fall. </p>

							<h2>Eye of the Grass</h2>
							<p>I was really inspired to title this image the "Eye of the Grass" because of the dimension of the picture. The shot was taken directly at eye level so it looks as if you are in third person, on the ground, looking through the grass at the background scenary. This too is also an unedited photo.</p>

							<h2>OVERLOOK</h2>
							<p>I titled this photo "OVERLOOK" because the shot was taken from an overpass on interstate 81. The shot is very beautiful and brings to attention to the viewers the difference between the trees that have experienced fall and the trees who are still waiting to shed. This photo is unedited. </p>

							<h2>Fallen Tree</h2>
							<p>This is a shot that I took that is edited through photoshop. I chose to up the saturation and brighten the colors to reveal a sharper final image. The sharper image shows the distinct difference between the color of the leaves included in the shot. The fall trees are decorated with colors of Fall orange and Fall red. </p>

									<h2>Who am I?</h2>
									<p>My name is Christopher Taleghani and I am a Sophomore here at Virginia Tech. I am a Multimedia Journalism major with a concentration in Sports Media and Analytics. I am from Yorktown, Virginia and have one sister who also graduated from Virginia Tech and one brother who will be graduating from UVA this upcoming 2019 Spring and then moving on to Medical School. I also have a younger brother who is about to go through the college application process. </p><br>
									<p>Being around cameras and photography has always been a big passion of mine, but I have only tested these passions in the sports world. I currently am a Videographer for a Media outlet called HoopDiamonds. You can check out this page by clicking on the YouTube link below! I basically travel around the country filming the highest level basketball players at the middle school, high school, and college level. This job has kept me busy for the past two years and has helped me love what I do even more. </p><br>
									<p>This photo gallery project helped me expand my skills in an entirely different field. It was fun to take pictures of an entirely different subject other than sports. Taking still shots seems hard, but sometimes it takes five maybe even eight different shots of the same thing to get the best possible picture. It was fun to travel around the Blacksburg area and visit pumpkin patches to see all the different places where the season "Fall" was most shown. Editing pictures after taking this is always a good time because you can test different things and change stuff up through Adobe Photoshop and get an entirely different picture than originally seen. </p><br>
